# Notes

## Javascript

```
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces.

Before 2015, using the var keyword was the only way to declare a JavaScript variable.
The 2015 version of JavaScript (ES6) allows the use of the const keyword to define a variable that cannot be reassigned, and the let keyword to define a variable with restricted scope.

You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated


```

## Bootstrap
```
align-items-center
```

## CSS
```
margin-top: 50vh;
```
